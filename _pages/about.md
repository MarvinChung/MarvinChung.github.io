I am a Computer Vision and Robotics researcher specializing in real-time SLAM systems, with a focus on Neural Implicit Representations such as Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting. My masterâ€™s research, supervised by Winston Hsu, provided a strong foundation in these areas.

In addition, I gained valuable experience working with Large Language Models during my time at MediaTek Research. 

Currently, I am affiliated with Academia Sinica, where I collaborate with Yu-Te Wang on integrating brain signals with robotics. My research aims to advance prosthetic technology through innovations in brain-computer interfaces.
